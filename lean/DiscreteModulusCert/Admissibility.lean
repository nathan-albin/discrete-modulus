# The Kruskal-admissibility trust boundary, as a named axiom

This project's one accepted soundness gap: `Kruskal.run`'s output is
trusted, not proven, to be a minimum-weight base of the graphic matroid.
`CertChecker.lean` already uses that trust (computing a density's
admissibility via Kruskal's MST weight), but only as an ordinary runtime
`Bool` check; nothing marks *where* the trust enters the kernel-checked
side. This file makes that boundary an explicit Lean `axiom`, so it shows
up by name under `#print axioms` for any certificate whose `rho` isn't
uniform.

**No connectedness hypothesis.** `IsAdmissible`/`Pmf` (`Family.lean`) are
stated purely over an abstract `Matroid E`, with no reference to graph
connectivity. Kruskal's algorithm, exactly as coded in `Kruskal.lean` (sort
edges ascending by weight, greedily keep each that joins two still-separate
union-find components), is the general matroid-greedy algorithm for the
graphic matroid: it produces a minimum-weight *base* (a spanning forest,
one tree per component) whether or not the graph is connected. So this
axiom never needs to establish or assume `G` is connected.

**The complementary fact: when you don't need this axiom at all.**
`isAdmissible_const_div_ncard_of_isBase` below shows a *uniform* density
is admissible directly from a basic matroid fact (every base has the same
cardinality), with no MST oracle anywhere. This is the case `house`'s
certificate falls into (`rho = 1/4` on every edge), used by
`EndToEndTest.lean` to build a fully axiom-free optimality proof for it.

/-- **A uniform density is admissible whenever one base's size is known,
with no MST oracle needed.** Every base of a matroid has the same
cardinality (`Matroid.IsBase.ncard_eq_ncard_of_isBase`), so fixing one
known base `T₀`'s size pins down every other base's pairing against the
uniform density `1 / T₀.ncard` to exactly `1`. This is the complementary
fact to `Kruskal.run_isAdmissible_of_weight_ge_one` below: for a
certificate whose optimal density happens to be uniform, admissibility
follows directly from this, with no unverified oracle anywhere. -/

/-- **This project's accepted, unverified admissibility oracle, as a named
axiom.** Bridges "Kruskal's computed minimum-spanning-forest weight is
`≥ 1`" directly to `IsAdmissible`, at exactly the granularity needed:
bridging the computed weight to admissibility directly, rather than
decomposing into "Kruskal computes a minimum base" plus a separate logical
step. This is the one place trust enters the kernel-checked side for a
certificate whose `rho` isn't uniform. `endpoints : Array (Fin n × Fin n)`
matches `CheckedGraph`'s own shape exactly, so applying this axiom at a
`CertChecker` call site only needs one small value-level bridging lemma
(`Soundness.lean`), not a graph rebuild. -/
