# A runnable JSON certificate checker

A standalone verifier: reads a certificate JSON file at *program runtime*
and checks every invariant `validate_certificate` (the untrusted
Python-side sanity check) also checks, but this time running the same
computable decidability instance `ForestDecide.lean` built
(`instDecidableIsForestOfList`) against the parsed data, not just a
syntactic sanity check. A certificate is a JSON object with a top-level
graph (vertex count plus a global edge list), a flat ordered `pieces`
array (each piece its own edge subset plus a local pmf over that piece's
own spanning trees, as edge-index lists with rational weights), and
top-level `eta`/`rho` arrays (one rational per edge). See
`RawCertificate`/`RawPiece`/`RawTree` below for the exact shape parsed.

See `docs/certification/schema.md` for the authoritative field-by-field
certificate schema reference, and
`docs/certification/certificate_schema.json` for the machine-checkable
JSON Schema.

**Checked (not trusted) `eta`/`rho` fields.** The certificate declares
the optimal pmf's marginal (`eta`) and admissible density (`rho`) per
edge. This checker recomputes both independently from `pieces` (the same
composition `Pmf.glue_marginal`/`PieceList.glueAll_marginal`, `Glue.lean`,
prove sound; linear in pieces times edges, never the glued pmf's
exponential support) and rejects the certificate if the declared values
don't match. Nothing is trusted that wasn't already being derived; the
certificate's own `eta`/`rho` are now legible without running this
checker at all, and diffable directly against the C++ solver's own
`*.eta` output.

**Admissibility of `rho`, via the accepted Kruskal-oracle gap
(`Kruskal.lean`).** `rho` is admissible iff *every* spanning tree has
`rho`-weight `≥ 1`, which holds iff the *minimum*-weight spanning tree
does. `Kruskal.run` computes that minimum greedily; its correctness (that
the greedy algorithm's output is a minimum spanning tree) is this
project's one deliberately unverified step: the result is trusted, not
proven. This checker still rejects a certificate whose Kruskal-computed
minimum weight is `< 1`; only the algorithm's own correctness, not
whether the check runs, is unverified.

**Why this is a plain executable, not `decide`/`native_decide` on a proof
term.** `EndToEndTest.lean` proves facts about *specific* certificates
whose data is fixed at elaboration time (embedded via `include_str`), so
`decide`/`native_decide` (tactics that close a proof goal once, at
elaboration time) are the right tool there. A certificate's actual
content is only known when this program *runs* (read from a file path
given on the command line), so there is no fixed goal for a tactic to
close at elaboration time. The right tool instead is ordinary functional
code: `instDecidableIsForestOfList` is a computable `Decidable` instance
(structural recursion, no `Classical.choice` anywhere; see its own file),
so writing `if G.IsForest (S l) then ... else ...` in a regular
(non-tactic) definition compiles to executable code that runs the same
forest-decision algorithm against whatever list `l` this program parsed
at runtime. This file's checks are all phrased this way: plain, computable
predicates over `List`/`Fin m`/`ℚ`, never touching `Set E`'s classical
equality (unlike `Pmf.support : Finset (Set E)`, which is noncomputable).
This is deliberate, since a runtime checker has to actually run.

**What this does and doesn't establish, by itself.** This checks exactly
what `validate_certificate` checks, faithfully and independently, using
the forest-decision algorithm itself rather than a syntactic proxy: piece
edges disjoint and covering the whole graph, every declared tree a forest
and maximal within its piece (so a base of that piece's matroid, via the
same `isBase_contract_restrict_iff_isForest` reduction `Soundness.lean`'s
`checkTree_sound` uses), and weights nonnegative and summing to 1 per
piece. Running `checkCertificate` and getting `ok` back is, by itself,
only a runtime fact, not a kernel-checked proof term. That gap (a
universally-quantified soundness theorem: "if this checker returns `ok`,
a `PieceList`/`Pmf` exists for the same data, and it's optimal") is closed
separately, by `Soundness.lean`'s
`checkCertificate_sound`/`checkCertificate_optimal`, linking this
computable checker to the noncomputable `Pmf`/`certificate_optimality`
machinery, the way `instDecidableIsForestOfList` already links `decide`
to `IsForest`.

/-- Checks one declared tree (`T`, a piece's own edge sublist) against an
already-accumulated representative base `I₀acc` of everything processed so
far: `T ⊆ A`, `I₀acc ++ T` is a forest, and no edge of `A \ T` can be added
without creating a cycle (`isBase_contract_restrict_iff_isForest`'s two
halves, computed directly rather than proved about fixed literals).

The maximality half uses `decidableIsForestInsertOfComponents` against a
components cache built *once* per tree (`forestComponents`) rather than a
fresh `decide (G.IsForest (S (I₀acc ++ (e :: T))))` per candidate `e`. Two
compounding redundancies made the naive version too slow on certificate
pieces of realistic size (`nested.certificate.json`'s 190-edge/10-tree
piece): `instDecidableIsForestOfList` recomputes one reachability check
per recursion level (`O(|I₀acc ++ T|)` of them) for *every* candidate, and
even after that was collapsed to a single check per candidate
(`decidableIsForestInsertOfList`), each of those still reran its own
connected-components search against a base graph that never changes
across the whole `A \ T` loop. Building the base graph's connected
components once (see `ForestDecide.lean`'s `mergeStep`/`buildComponents`)
and reusing them for every candidate turns each check into a cheap
`List`/`Finset` lookup instead. -/

/-- Checks one piece's whole local pmf: every declared tree passes
`checkTree`, weights are nonnegative, and they sum to exactly `1`. Returns
the piece's own edge list `A` and the *first* declared tree (an arbitrary

`Nat`/`Fin m` rather than through `checkPiece`/`checkPieces`'s generic
`{V E : Type*} [Fintype E]` abstraction: that abstraction has no
computable `E → Fin m` projection available generically
(`Fintype.equivFin` is `noncomputable`). Working directly from the raw
`Nat`-indexed JSON data, where `m` is already concrete, sidesteps this
entirely. See `docs/certification/pipeline.md`'s "implementation notes"
