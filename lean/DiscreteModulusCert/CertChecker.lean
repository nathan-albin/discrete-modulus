# A runnable JSON certificate checker

PR 5's first genuinely standalone verifier: reads a certificate JSON file
(`scratch/certificate_schema.json`, v4) at *program runtime* and checks
every invariant `validate_certificate` (the untrusted Python-side sanity
check) checks, but this time using the same computable decidability
instance `ForestDecide.lean` built (`instDecidableIsForestOfList`) --
genuinely running Cunningham/forest-decision code against the parsed data,
not just a syntactic sanity check.

**Why this is a plain executable, not `decide`/`native_decide` on a proof
term.** `HouseCert.lean` proved facts about *specific, hand-transcribed
edge-index literals* -- data known when Lean itself was compiled, so
`decide`/`native_decide` (tactics that close a proof goal once, at
elaboration time) were the right tool. A certificate's actual content is
only known when this program *runs* (read from a file path given on the
command line), so there is no fixed goal for a tactic to close at
elaboration time at all. The right tool instead is ordinary functional
code: `instDecidableIsForestOfList` is a genuinely computable `Decidable`
instance (structural recursion, no `Classical.choice` anywhere -- see its
own file), so writing `if G.IsForest (S l) then ... else ...` in a regular
(non-tactic) definition compiles to real executable code that runs the
same forest-decision algorithm against whatever list `l` this program
parsed at runtime. This file's checks are all phrased this way: plain,
computable predicates over `List`/`Fin m`/`ℚ`, never touching `Set E`'s
classical equality (unlike `Pmf.support : Finset (Set E)`, which is
genuinely noncomputable) -- deliberately so, since a runtime checker has to
actually *run*.

**What this does and doesn't establish (see `Certification_Plan.md` §5.1.6
follow-up items).** This checks exactly what `validate_certificate` checks,
faithfully and independently, using the real forest-decision algorithm
rather than a syntactic proxy: piece edges disjoint and covering the whole
graph, every declared tree is a genuine forest and maximal within its
piece (so a genuine base of that piece's matroid, via the same
`isBase_contract_restrict_iff_isForest` reduction `HouseCert.lean` uses),
and weights nonnegative and summing to 1 per piece. It does *not* yet
produce a Lean proof TERM (a `Pmf`/`PieceList` value) the kernel has
type-checked -- that needs a separate, universally-quantified soundness
theorem ("if this checker returns `ok`, a genuine `PieceList`/`Pmf` exists
for the same data"), proved once at compile time over arbitrary input,
linking this computable checker to the noncomputable `Pmf` machinery the
way `instDecidableIsForestOfList` already links `decide` to `IsForest`.
Tracked as the next step, not yet done here.

/-- Checks one declared tree (`T`, a piece's own edge sublist) against an
already-accumulated representative base `I₀acc` of everything processed so
far: `T ⊆ A`, `I₀acc ++ T` is a forest, and no edge of `A \ T` can be added
without creating a cycle (`isBase_contract_restrict_iff_isForest`'s two
halves, computed directly rather than proved about fixed literals).

The maximality half uses `decidableIsForestInsertOfComponents` against a
components cache built *once* per tree (`forestComponents`) rather than a
fresh `decide (G.IsForest (S (I₀acc ++ (e :: T))))` per candidate `e`. Two
compounding redundancies made the naive version too slow on real
certificate pieces (`nested.certificate.json`'s 190-edge/10-tree piece):
`instDecidableIsForestOfList` recomputes one reachability check per
recursion level (`O(|I₀acc ++ T|)` of them) for *every* candidate, and even
after that was collapsed to a single check per candidate
(`decidableIsForestInsertOfList`), each of those still reran a fresh
`bfsClosure` against a base graph that never changes across the whole
`A \ T` loop. Building the base graph's connected components once and
reusing them for every candidate turns each check into a cheap `List`/
`Finset` lookup instead. -/
